1. In 'Files' there is 2 '.m' files.
2. main.m is for classifying the image using the SVM classifier.
3. Segemntimg.m for segmenting the image using texture filter i.e., Gabor Filter.
4. 'train-Med-img' folder contains image for the training dataset for SVM classifier (99 images taken).
5. 'test-Med-img' folder contains image for the testing of SVM classifier (32 images).
6. In SVM classifier I am getting the Accuracy: 62.87%. I am not sure how to increase the efficiency may be by taking a large number of Images for Training dataset.
